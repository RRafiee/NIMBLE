# NanoString gene expression classifiation

Medulloblastoma subgrouping using an optimised nanoString classifier derived from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data

## Input:
A csv file including raw data (expression level) of 36 medulloblastoma subgroup-specific signature genes using nanoString nCounter Technology.

The column names are sample names while row names must be 36 gene names (no need to be oredered) 

## Output:
Classifier confidence and subgroup labels for the samples
